    "Measures of central tendency: These are statistics that summarize the center of a distribution, such as mean, median, and mode. For example, the mean salary of employees in a company. \n",

    "Employee 3--> 11\n",
    "Employee 4--> 11\n",
    "Employee 5--> 15\n",

    "For descriptive statistics, we can find mean, median or mode of the salay. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Mode** = 11 (highest occurence of any salary, here 11 occurs twice)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inderential Statistics:** Inferential statistics involves using data from a sample to make inferences about a larger population. It provides a way to draw conclusions from data that are not directly observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Hypothesis testing: This is a method for testing whether a claim or hypothesis about a population is supported by the data. For example, testing whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug.\n",
