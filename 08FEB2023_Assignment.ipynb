A bank account may have many complex operations, such as depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring funds, checking the balance, and so on. However, the user only needs to interact with a simplified interface that abstracts away all the complex details. The user can simply deposit or withdraw money without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that make it possible."

We focus only on the essential features of a car, ignoring the non-essential ones.\n",

Similarly, the internal workings of a car, such as the fuel injection system and electrical systems, are hidden from us. This is an example of encapsulation. The internal workings of a car are encapsulated within the car, and we can't access them directly. We can only interact with the car through its interface, such as the steering wheel, pedals, and dashboard."

By hiding the implementation details of an object, encapsulation provides a way to achieve data abstraction.\n",
